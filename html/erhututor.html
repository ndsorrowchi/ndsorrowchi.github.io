						<p>Ming started learning the erhu since 9 years old. He learned erhu from expert erhu teachers in his province. He improved fast and learned a large amount of traditional Chinese music. He got his 10th-level certificate when he was in junior high school.<br></p>
						<p>Since then Ming began to learn more about traditional music with specific regional features. When he was 17 years old, he got a gold prize in his province with Chinese northern-style music "江河水" and “秦腔主题随想曲”.</p>
						<p>In his undergraduate period he began to practice more western style music such as "Czardas", and modern Chinese erhu music like “The First Erhu Rhapsody”.</p>

						In his university, Ming worked in the Chinese Orchestra in the university and participated in several shows and contests. The orchestra had its own 10th-year anniversary show, with "庆典序曲", “天路”, “台湾追想曲”, “十面埋伏”, “情歌王”, “我的祖国”, “赛马” played, which was a big success and achieved the best music the orchestra ever had. </p>
						<p>Ming is essential for string music part for his experience in erhu, including common and uncommon modes, special techniques and the practicing system. Ming has played erhu, zhonghu and gaohu in the orchestra, with a lot of work preparing for shows and as well, helping the erhu teacher training a group of students who has no experience in erhu ever. Later the Orchestra won a first prize with the music "庆典序曲" in Hubei province and a second prize in China.</p>
